# OSPaymentsPluginLib-iOS

The `OSPaymentsPluginLib-iOS` is a library build using `Swift` that lets you set a payment experience using Apple Pay. It allows to set the payment's details, such as the merchantâ€™s information, payment amount and currency, as well as shipping and billing address. This information can then used to process a payment within an app.

The `OSPMTActionDelegate` protocol, along with the class that implements it - `OSPMTPayments` - allows this interaction, providing the following operations:
- Setup Payment Configuration
- Check if Device is Ready for Payment
- Set Details and Trigger Payment

Each is detailed on following sections.

## Motivation

This library is to be used by the [Payments Plugin](https://github.com/OutSystems/cordova-outsystems-payments). The repository contains a `podspec` file that is published and available on the `CocoaPods`' repository, and should be imported on the Cordova bridge as a `pod`.

## Usage

1. Include the `OSPaymentsPluginLib` pod in the Cordova Bridge. o accomplish this, the following needs to be inserted into the `plugin.xml` file. The `spec` field should be changed to the version the developer desires to use.

```xml
<platform>
	...
	<podspec>
        <config>
            <source url="https://cdn.cocoapods.org/"/>
        </config>
        <pods use-frameworks="true">
        	...
            <pod name="OSPaymentsPluginLib" spec="{VERSION TO USE}" />
            ...
        </pods>
    </podspec>
	...
</platform>
```

2. Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/) and configure the Provisioning Profile with the `Apple Pay Payment Processing` and `In-App Purchase` capabilities enabled.

## Methods

The library provides the following methods to interact with:

### Setup Payment Configuration

```swift
func setupConfiguration()
```

Sets up the payment configuration.

The method's success is returned through a `OSPMTCallbackDelegate` call. Success operations returns an object of the structure type `OSPMTConfigurationModel`, encoded in a UTF-8 string. An `OSPMTError` error is returned in case of error.

### Check if Device is Ready for Payment

```swift
func checkWalletSetup()
```

Verifies the device is ready to process a payment, considering the configuration provided before.

The method's success is returned through a `OSPMTCallbackDelegate` call. Success operations returns an empty string or a `OSPMTError` error otherwise.

### Set Details and Trigger Payment

```swift
func set(_ details: String, and: accessToken: String?)
```

Sets payment details and triggers the request proccess. The method contains the following parameter:
- `details`: Payment details model serialized into a text field. This model can be checked in the `OSPMTDetailsModel` structure.
- `accessToken`: Authorisation token related with a full payment type. Can be empty, which should be the case for custom payments.

The method's success is returned through a `OSPMTCallbackDelegate` call. Success operations returns an object of the structure type `OSPMTScopeModel`, encoded in a UTF-8 string. An `OSPMTError` error is returned in case of error.
