  The `OSPaymentsPluginLib-iOS` is a library build using `Swift` that lets you set a payment experience using Apple Pay. It allows to set the payment's details, such as the merchantâ€™s information, payment amount and currency, as well as shipping and billing address. This information can then used to process a payment within an app.

  The `OSPMTActionDelegate` protocol, along with the class that implements it - `OSPMTPayments` - allows this interaction, providing the following operations:
  - Setup Payment Configuration
  - Check if Device is Ready for Payment
  - Set Details and Trigger Payment
